# PP250 Fast Boot — Design & Implementation Plan

## Background

The PP250 (Plessey UK, 1972) responded to any fault with a hardware-enforced
three-instruction boot sequence.  There was no countdown, no firmware
handshake, no polling loop.  Fault detected → three instructions executed →
machine running again.  The whole recovery was measured in nanoseconds.

The Church Machine inherits this principle.  The three boot instructions are
already burned into `hardware/boot_rom.py`:

```
[0] LOAD   AL, CR15, CR15[0]   — load full namespace into CR15
[1] CHANGE AL, CR12, CR15, #1  — switch to Boot.Thread; CRs 0-11 restored from thread caps
[2] CALL   AL, CR0,  CR0       — enter the IDE-configured boot entry abstraction
```

The hardware boot FSM in `hardware/core.py` runs these in six clock cycles:

```
IDLE → FAULT_RST → LOAD_NS → INIT_THRD → INIT_CLIST → LOAD_NUC → COMPLETE
```

At 25 MHz that is **240 nanoseconds** from `boot_start` pulse to
`boot_complete` high.  At 50 MHz (with PLL) it is 120 ns.

---

## Problem: What Is Actually Slow Today

The hardware itself is instant.  The firmware (`hardware/soc_combined/firmware/main.c`)
wraps the 240 ns hardware boot in **≥ 7 seconds of pure waiting** before the
CM is even kicked:

| Delay | Duration | Code location | Why it exists |
|-------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| "CONNECT NOW" countdown | **5.0 s** | Step 2b — `delay_loops` × 5 | Give a late terminal time to open |
| Poll `CM_STATUS_BOOT_COMPLETE` | **up to 8.0 s** | Step 3 wait loop | Timeout guard |
| Button-hold kick (`CM_CTRL_PRESSED`) | **1.04 s** | After poll | Assert `boot_start` long enough |

Total worst-case cold-boot delay before first CALLHOME: **≈ 14 seconds**.

### On fault: nothing recovers the machine

The monitor loop reads `CM_STATUS_FAULT_LATCHED` every second and includes
the fault code in the CALLHOME JSON.  It does **not** pulse `CM_CTRL_PRESSED`
to re-assert `boot_start`.  The CM sits in a faulted COMPLETE state forever.
Recovery requires a full power-cycle, which re-runs the 14-second sequence.

This is the opposite of the PP250 model.

## Hardware Boot FSM — Current State

`hardware/core.py`, signal `boot_state_reg` (3-bit), driven by `self.boot_start`:

```python
with m.Case(BootState.IDLE):
    with m.If(self.boot_start):
        m.d.sync += boot_state_reg.eq(BootState.FAULT_RST)
with m.Case(BootState.FAULT_RST):
    m.d.sync += boot_state_reg.eq(BootState.LOAD_NS)
with m.Case(BootState.LOAD_NS):
    m.d.sync += boot_state_reg.eq(BootState.INIT_THRD)
with m.Case(BootState.INIT_THRD):
    m.d.sync += boot_state_reg.eq(BootState.INIT_CLIST)
with m.Case(BootState.INIT_CLIST):
    m.d.sync += boot_state_reg.eq(BootState.LOAD_NUC)
with m.Case(BootState.LOAD_NUC):
    m.d.sync += boot_state_reg.eq(BootState.COMPLETE)
with m.Case(BootState.COMPLETE):
    m.d.sync += boot_state_reg.eq(BootState.COMPLETE)   # stays here until fault or reboot
```

A `u_return.reboot_request` already drives `boot_state_reg → FAULT_RST`
(core.py line 734).  `fault_valid` does **not** directly trigger this path —
it is only exposed on the APB3 STATUS register for firmware to read.

## Three-Track Implementation Plan

### Track 1 — Firmware Only (no new bitstream)

**File:** `hardware/soc_combined/firmware/main.c`

**Goal:** Cut cold boot from ≥ 14 s to ≤ 0.5 s.  Add fault recovery without
power-cycle.

#### Change 1 — Remove the 5-second countdown

```c
/* BEFORE (Step 2b) */
uart_puts("CONNECT NOW — APB3 init in 5s\r\n");
for (uint32_t cd = 5; cd > 0; cd--) {
    uart_puts("  T-");
    uart_putc('0' + (char)cd);
    uart_puts("\r\n");
    delay_loops(LOOPS_PER_SECOND);   // 5 × 1 s = 5 s wasted
}

/* AFTER */
uart_puts("CONNECT NOW\r\n");        // immediate; CALLHOME repeats every second anyway
```

Late-connecting terminals will see the CALLHOME announcement within 1 second
of connecting.  No information is lost.

#### Change 2 — Shorten the button-hold kick from 1.04 s to 5 ms

`boot_start` is sampled on the rising edge of the clock.  One clock at 25 MHz
is 40 ns.  The firmware only needs to hold `CM_CTRL_PRESSED` long enough for
the APB3 write to complete — microseconds, not seconds.

```c
/* BEFORE */
CM_CTRL = CM_CTRL_PRESSED;
delay_loops(LOOPS_PER_SECOND + LOOPS_PER_SECOND / 25);  /* ~1.04 s */
CM_CTRL = CM_CTRL_RELEASED;

/* AFTER */
CM_CTRL = CM_CTRL_PRESSED;
delay_loops(CLK_HZ / 200);   /* 5 ms — plenty for APB3 write + clock sync */
CM_CTRL = CM_CTRL_RELEASED;
```

#### Change 3 — Add fault recovery in the monitor loop

When `FAULT_LATCHED` is detected: log it to UART, then immediately re-pulse
`CM_CTRL_PRESSED` to fire `boot_start`.  The hardware FSM runs the three boot
instructions in 240 ns and `boot_complete` goes high again.

```c
/* Inside the monitor for(;;) loop, after reading CM_STATUS: */
if (status & CM_STATUS_FAULT_LATCHED) {
    uart_puts(" FAULT=");
    uart_puthex32(CM_FAULT & 0x1F);
    uart_puts("\r\n");
    uart_puts("[PP250] FAULT_RST — pulsing boot_start\r\n");
    CM_CTRL = CM_CTRL_PRESSED;
    delay_loops(CLK_HZ / 200);          /* 5 ms */
    CM_CTRL = CM_CTRL_RELEASED;
    /* Wait for CM to re-complete boot (hardware takes 6 cycles = 240 ns) */
    for (uint32_t t = 0; t < 10; t++) {
        if (CM_STATUS & CM_STATUS_BOOT_COMPLETE) break;
        delay_loops(CLK_HZ / 1000);     /* 1 ms per poll, 10 ms max */
    }
    uart_puts("[PP250] boot_complete after fault recovery\r\n");
}
```

**Result after Track 1:**

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Cold boot to first CALLHOME | ≥ 14 s | ≤ 0.5 s |
| Fault recovery | power-cycle required | ≤ 10 ms |
| New bitstream required | — | No |

---

### Track 2 — Simulator Mirrors Hardware

**File:** `simulator/simulator.js`

The simulator's `_bootStep()` state machine has 8 steps driven one at a time
by `step()`.  After Track 1 the hardware recovers in ≤ 10 ms; the simulator
must match that feel — instant, not step-by-step.

#### Add `_fastBoot()`

New method that executes all boot state in one synchronous call, replacing
the step-loop for fault-recovery paths.

```
_fastBoot()
  1. FAULT_RST — clear all CRs/DRs, flags, stack; set mElevation=true; log fault message
  2. LOAD_NS   — CR15 ← NS Slot 0 (namespace root)
  3. LOAD_NUC  — CR12 ← thread; heap/sp_max; CR6 ← E-GT for boot entry;
                 sentinel frame pushed; CR14 ← code lump; PC=0;
                 mElevation=false; bootComplete=true
  4. setTimeout(() => _asyncCallHome(), 0)  — fire CALLHOME after boot, non-blocking
```

The existing `_bootStep()` state machine is kept intact for the interactive
Pipeline view / single-step educational mode.

#### Wire into fault paths

- `fault()` — after writing the `faultLog` entry: call `_fastBoot()` instead of halting
- `_tier3Recovery()` — replace `_returnToBoot()` with `_fastBoot()`

#### Update tests

`simulator/test_fault_recovery.js` Tier 3 assertions currently expect
`bootComplete=false` after `_tier3Recovery()`.  With fast-boot these must change:

- `bootComplete` must be `true` immediately after fault
- `halted` must be `false`
- `pc` must be `0`
- Machine must accept `step()` without any manual boot steps

**Result after Track 2:** Simulator fault recovery is instant, matching
Track 1 hardware behaviour.  No bitstream needed.

---

### Track 3 — Hardware Auto-Reboot on Fault (new bitstream)

**File:** `hardware/core.py`

True PP250 behaviour: the hardware itself detects `fault_valid` and immediately
re-enters `FAULT_RST` without any firmware involvement.  No APB3 pulse needed.

#### Add auto-reboot on `fault_valid`

In the sync domain, add a priority condition alongside the existing
`u_return.reboot_request` path (core.py line 734):

```python
with m.If(u_return.reboot_request | (self.fault_valid & self.boot_complete)):
    m.d.sync += [boot_state_reg.eq(BootState.FAULT_RST), nia_reg.eq(0)]
```

Cycle-by-cycle sequence on any fault:

| Cycle | `boot_state_reg` | What happens |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| N | COMPLETE | `fault_valid` high — instruction faulted |
| N+1 | FAULT_RST | all CRs/DRs cleared |
| N+2 | LOAD_NS | CR15 loaded |
| N+3 | INIT_THRD | CR12 loaded |
| N+4 | INIT_CLIST | C-list loaded |
| N+5 | LOAD_NUC | CR14 + PC set |
| N+6 | COMPLETE | `boot_complete` high — CM running again |

**Total hardware fault recovery: 6 clock cycles = 240 ns at 25 MHz.**

Firmware still reads `CM_STATUS_FAULT_LATCHED` (sticky bit) and logs it in
the CALLHOME packet.  Track 1 Change 3 simplifies to logging only — no
manual pulse needed.

**Requires:** Re-synthesis in Efinix Efinity → new `.bit` bitstream →
`run_efx_pgm.sh` to flash Ti60 F225.

## Recommended Build Order

1. **Track 1** — firmware only; recompile and flash today.
   Confirm cold boot ≤ 0.5 s and fault recovery ≤ 10 ms over UART at 57600 baud.

2. **Track 2** — simulator matches firmware; run `fault-recovery-tests` and
   update Tier 3 assertions.

3. **Track 3** — schedule Efinity synthesis run.  Test on hardware.
   Simplify firmware fault handler to log-only (hardware self-recovers).

## Timing Summary

| Phase | Cold boot to CALLHOME | Fault recovery |
|-------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Today (pre-change) | ≥ 14 s | power-cycle required |
| After Track 1 (firmware) | ≤ 0.5 s | ≤ 10 ms |
| After Track 3 (hardware) | ≤ 0.5 s | 240 ns (6 cycles at 25 MHz) |
| PP250 original | — | nanoseconds |

---

## Notes

- `CLK_HZ = 25000000` (25 MHz). If PLL ×2 is enabled later, change timing
  figures to 50 MHz / 120 ns per cycle.
- `LOOPS_PER_SECOND = CLK_HZ / 4 = 6,250,000` — each `delay_loops(n)` call
  burns approximately `n × 4` clock cycles.
- `CM_CTRL_PRESSED = 0`, `CM_CTRL_RELEASED = 1` (active-low push_button).
- The three boot instructions (`LOAD`, `CHANGE`, `CALL`) are fixed in
  `hardware/boot_rom.py`; they do not change across any of the three tracks.
- The CALLHOME JSON packet already carries `fault` and `fault_code` fields;
  no new packet fields are needed.
