# mLoad — The Single Trusted Gate

mLoad is the hardware micro-operation that every Church instruction uses to
read a Golden Token from memory and make it live in a Capability Register.
No GT can enter a CR by any other path. mLoad is not an instruction —
it is a sub-operation invoked internally by LOAD, CALL, RETURN, CHANGE,
SWITCH, TPERM, LAMBDA, ELOADCALL, and XLOADLAMBDA.

## Why One Gate

Every security property of the Church Machine is enforced in mLoad:

| Property | Where enforced |
|---|---|
| Absent Outform objects are detected and trigger a lazy-load event | CHECK\_NS stage (type check on GT) |
| Only L-perm holders can unlock the permitted access right(s) to the object or resource defined by a GT in their posession | CHECK\_L stage |
| No capability can be read beyond its index range | CHECK\_BOUNDS stage |
| No revoked GT can be re-used | CHECK\_VERSION stage (gt\_seq match) |
| No forged GT can ever load | CHECK\_VERSION + seal stage (CRC-16/CCITT) |
| GC always knows which slots are live | RESET\_GBIT stage |
| Thread lump always mirrors live CRs | UPDATE\_THREAD stage |

Because all eight properties collapse to a single code path, the attack
surface is a small, formally verifiable FSM rather than a distributed set
of per-instruction permission checks.

## Callers

| Instruction | When mLoad fires | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **LOAD** | Every execution | Load one GT from c-list into a CR |
| **CALL** | Phase 2 (post E-perm check) | Populate CR6 (c-list) and CR14 (code) from callee NS slot |
| **RETURN** | Restoring caller context | Reload caller's CR6 from the return frame |
| **CHANGE** | Load target thread + restore CRs | Switch thread context; restore per-thread capability set |
| **SWITCH** | Context switch to new thread | Load the incoming thread's capability set into CRs |
| **TPERM** | Permission transfer phase | Load the delegated GT into the recipient's CR |
| **LAMBDA** | Closure capture | Load the closed-over GT into the lambda's internal CR slot |
| **ELOADCALL** | Extended load-and-call | Load GT and immediately populate CRs for the callee entry point |
| **XLOADLAMBDA** | Cross-domain lambda invocation | Load the lambda GT across a domain boundary into the target CR |

CHANGE uses its own private `ChurchMLoad` instance; LOAD, CALL, RETURN,
SWITCH, TPERM, LAMBDA, ELOADCALL, and XLOADLAMBDA share a single
`u_shared_mload` arbiter in the core.

## Inputs

| Signal | Width | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sub_start` | 1 | Pulse to begin a mLoad |
| `sub_cr_src` | 4 | Source CR number — holds the c-list GT (CR6 normally) |
| `sub_cr_dst` | 4 | Destination CR number — where the loaded GT lands |
| `sub_index` | 16 | Index into the c-list pointed to by CR\_src |
| `sub_direct` | 1 | **Direct mode**: skip c-list read; use `sub_direct_gt` as the GT |
| `sub_direct_gt` | 32 | Raw GT word used when `sub_direct = 1` |
| `sub_m_elevated` | 1 | **M-elevation**: skip L-perm check (used by CALL, CHANGE internally) |

---

## Outputs

| Signal | Width | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sub_busy` | 1 | High while FSM is not IDLE |
| `sub_done` | 1 | Pulses high on COMPLETE — GT is in CR\_dst |
| `sub_fault` | 1 | Pulses high on FAULT |
| `sub_fault_type` | 4 | `FaultType` code (see table below) |
| `cr_wr_addr` | 4 | CR number being written |

| `cr_wr_en` | 1 | Write-enable for the register file |
| `gbit_reset_done` | 1 | Pulses high after the G-bit write-back (GC signal) |
| `thread_wr_en` | 1 | Write-enable for thread lump shadow copy |
| `thread_wr_idx` | 4 | CR index (0–7) being shadowed to the lump |
| `thread_wr_data` | 32 | GT word being written to thread lump shadow |

---

## Memory Reads

mLoad performs three or four sequential memory reads:

```
1. C-list GT word (if not direct mode)
   Address: CR_src.word1_location + (index × 4)
   Width:   32 bits — this is GT.word0 of the capability being loaded

2. NS entry word0 — Location (code base address)
   Address: CR15.word1_location + (slot_id × 16)
   Width:   32 bits

3. NS entry word1 — word1_w2 (limit_offset | gt_seq)
   Address: NS_entry_base + 4
   Width:   32 bits

4. NS entry word2 — word2_w3 (crc | g_bit)      [seal check enabled only]
   Address: NS_entry_base + 8
   Width:   32 bits
```

NS entry addresses use a 16-byte stride: `slot_id << 4`. The NS table
base comes from `CR15.word1_location`.

## Capability Written to CR\_dst

When mLoad completes successfully, a full 128-bit `CAP_REG` is assembled
from three separate memory reads and written to the destination CR:

| Word | Source | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `word0_gt` (32 b) | C-list entry | GT word: slot\_id, gt\_seq, gt\_type, perms, b\_flag |
| `word1_location` (32 b) | NS entry +0 | Code / data base address |
| `word2_w2` (32 b) | NS entry +4 | `limit_offset[20:0]` · `gt_seq[6:0]` · spare |
| `word3_w3` (32 b) | NS entry +8 | `crc[15:0]` · `g_bit` · spare (seal-check mode only) |

`word3_w3` is only populated when `ENABLE_SEAL_CHECK = True`; it is zero
otherwise.

---

## Seal Check — CRC-16/CCITT

When `ENABLE_SEAL_CHECK = True` (the default), mLoad recomputes a 16-bit
CRC in hardware and compares it to `word2_w3.crc`:

**Input bit-stream (89 bits, MSB-first):**

```
GT[24:0]         — 25 bits  (slot_id, gt_seq, gt_type; perms and b_flag excluded)
word1_location   — 32 bits  (code base address)
word1_w2         — 32 bits  (limit_offset | gt_seq)
─────────────────────────────
Total            89 bits
```

**Algorithm:** CRC-16/CCITT — polynomial `0x1021`, init `0xFFFF`, no
input reflection, no output XOR.

**Verification:**

```
computed_crc == NS_entry.word2_w3[15:0]
AND
GT.gt_seq == NS_entry.word1_w2[27:21]   (gt_seq field)
```

A mismatch in either check routes to FAULT with `FaultType.VERSION` or
`FaultType.SEAL` respectively. The two checks happen in the single
`CHECK_VERSION` state — version first, then seal, so a stale GT always
reports VERSION before the seal is even evaluated.

The 16-bit seal is computed by the IDE at upload time and stored in
`word2_w3`. The hardware re-derives it on every access; there is no
way to cache a pass result.

---

## G-bit and GC Integration

At `RESET_GBIT`, mLoad writes back NS entry `+8` with the `g_bit` field
forced to zero. The `gbit_reset_done` output pulses high for one cycle,
telling the GC unit that this NS slot was just accessed.

GC's mark phase sets `g_bit = 1` on every NS entry in the scan range.
Every successful mLoad clears `g_bit = 0` on the accessed entry.
GC's sweep phase collects entries where `g_bit` is still `1` — i.e.
entries that were not accessed since the last mark pass.

There is no separate reachability graph. mLoad *is* the reachability
signal.

---

## Thread Lump Shadow Update

At `UPDATE_THREAD`, if `cr_dst ≤ 7`, mLoad writes the 32-bit GT word
(`result_cap.word0_gt`) to the thread lump at offset `cr_dst`.

This keeps the thread lump's Capabilities zone (words +244…+255) in sync
with the live register file for CR0–CR7. When CHANGE suspends a thread, the
GT zone is already current — no separate save sweep is needed for those
registers.

CR8–CR15 (system and privileged registers) are not shadowed here; they are
handled separately by the CHANGE instruction itself.

---

## L Permission and M Elevation

Normally `sub_cr_src` must hold an L-perm GT — only a c-list GT (CR6) is
expected to have L. If `src_gt.perms[PERM_L] = 0` the check fails with
`PERM_L`.

M-elevation (`sub_m_elevated = 1`) bypasses this check. It is asserted only
by microcode (CALL, CHANGE) when the instruction itself supplies the source
GT through a known-trusted path. User code can never set M; it is invisible
to the ISA.

---

## Direct Mode

When `sub_direct = 1`, the c-list read and CHECK\_L / CHECK\_BOUNDS stages
are skipped entirely. The GT word in `sub_direct_gt` is used directly as
`result_cap.word0_gt`, and the FSM jumps straight to `CHECK_NS`. This is
used by CALL when it already holds the validated callee GT from the E-perm
check and wants to load the NS entry without re-reading the c-list.

---

## Fault Types

| Code | Name | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `0x7` | `NULL_CAP` | `CR_src` holds a null GT (gt\_type = 00) |
| `0x4` | `PERM_L` | `CR_src` lacks L permission and M is not elevated |
| `0x8` | `BOUNDS` | `index ≥ c-list limit` **or** `slot_id ≥ NS table size` |
| `0x9` | `VERSION` | `GT.gt_seq ≠ NS_entry.word1_w2.gt_seq` |
| `0xA` | `SEAL` | CRC-16/CCITT recomputed ≠ stored seal |

On any FAULT the destination CR is not modified and `sub_fault_type` holds
the first failing check. The FSM returns to IDLE in one cycle.
