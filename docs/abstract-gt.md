# Abstract GTs — Self-Describing Device Capabilities

**v1.0 — 2026-04-29**
**CONFIDENTIAL**

*Introduced in Task #406; UART, Button, and Timer migrated in Task #431.*

## Overview

An **Abstract GT** is a 32-bit capability word whose entire authority is
encoded in the word itself.  It needs no namespace table entry and no physical
lump in memory — the GT _is_ the capability.

Compare with an Inform GT (type=0b01) which names an NS slot:

| Property          | Inform GT    | Abstract GT      |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| NS table entry    | Required    | **None**        |
| Physical lump     | Required    | **None**        |
| Authority storage | NS entry    | GT word itself  |
| mLoad required    | Yes         | **No**          |
| DREAD/DWRITE path | mLoad → mem | Abstract Manager|

For 6 LEDs:
- **Before (Inform):** 1 NS slot + 1 lump (≥ 64 words) + 6 GTs all pointing at NS slot 12
- **After (Abstract):** 0 NS slots + 0 lump bytes + 6 self-describing GTs

## Word Layout

```
 31  30  29  28  27 | 26  25 | 24  23 | 22  ..  16 | 15  ..  0
[   ab_type (5b)   ] [R] [W] [ type ] [  gt_seq  ] [  ab_data  ]
      32 types          I/O   = 0b11     version     16-bit payload
```

| Field     | Bits    | Width | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------|
| `ab_type` | [31:27] | 5     | Abstract category (32 possible) |
| `R`       | [26]    | 1     | Read permission |
| `W`       | [25]    | 1     | Write permission |
| `type`    | [24:23] | 2     | = `0b11` — identifies Abstract GT |
| `gt_seq`  | [22:16] | 7     | Version/generation counter |
| `ab_data` | [15:0]  | 16    | Device-specific payload |

**X, L, S, E, B are repurposed as `ab_type` bits and must never be treated as
permissions on an Abstract GT.**  `createAbstractGT()` and `create_abstract_gt()`
only accept R and W.

---

## Abstract Type Registry (`ab_type`)

| `ab_type` | Category      | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `0x00`    | **I/O**       | Hardware device pins and registers |
| `0x01`    | **M-Elevation** | Sets CRn(M=1) — the M Abstraction |
| `0x02–0x1F` | Reserved   | Future abstract categories |

---

## I/O Sub-Encoding (`ab_type = 0x00`)

```
ab_data[15:8]  =  device_class   (what kind of device)
ab_data[7:0]   =  device_data    (register or pin index within the device)
```

| `device_class` | Device  | `device_data` |
|----------------|---------|---------------|
| `0x01`         | LED     | Pin index 0–5 |
| `0x02`         | UART    | Register offset: TX=0, STATUS=1, RX=2 |
| `0x03`         | Button  | Always 0 |
| `0x04`         | Timer   | TICKS_LO=0 … CTL=4 |
| `0x05`         | Display | DMA register offset |

### LED example — c-list slots 8–13 (Task #406)

```
Slot 8:  Abstract GT  ab_type=I/O  R|W  LED[0]  → 0x07800100
Slot 9:  Abstract GT  ab_type=I/O  R|W  LED[1]  → 0x07800101
Slot 10: Abstract GT  ab_type=I/O  R|W  LED[2]  → 0x07800102
Slot 11: Abstract GT  ab_type=I/O  R|W  LED[3]  → 0x07800103
Slot 12: Abstract GT  ab_type=I/O  R|W  LED[4]  → 0x07800104
Slot 13: Abstract GT  ab_type=I/O  R|W  LED[5]  → 0x07800105
```

Word breakdown for `0x07800100` (LED[0]):
- bits[31:27] = `0b00000` → ab_type = 0x00 (I/O)
- bit[26]     = `1`       → R permission
- bit[25]     = `1`       → W permission
- bits[24:23] = `0b11`    → type = Abstract
- bits[22:16] = `0b0000000` → gt_seq = 0
- bits[15:8]  = `0x01`    → device_class = LED
- bits[7:0]   = `0x00`    → device_data = pin 0

### UART, Button, Timer — c-list slots 14–16 (Task #431)

```
Slot 14: Abstract GT  ab_type=I/O  R|W  UART[0]   → 0x07800200  (TX register)
Slot 15: Abstract GT  ab_type=I/O  R    Button[0]  → 0x05800300  (state register)
Slot 16: Abstract GT  ab_type=I/O  R|W  Timer[0]   → 0x07800400  (TICKS_LO register)
```

NS slots 11 (UART), 13 (Button), 14 (Timer) are freed — no lump, no NS entry.
To access a different UART register (e.g. RX), create a new Abstract GT with
`device_data=2`: `ab_data = (DEVICE_CLASS_UART << 8) | 2` → GT word `0x07800202`.

DREAD/DWRITE dispatch uses `device_data` to select the register:

```
DREAD  DR1, CR_UART, 0    ; CR_UART holds UART[0] GT
  → Abstract Manager → UART.TX read → DR1 ← uartRegs[0]

DWRITE DR1, CR_TIMER, 0   ; DR1=0xDEAD → write Timer TICKS_LO
  → Abstract Manager → Timer.TICKS_LO write → timerRegs[0] = DR1

DREAD  DR1, CR_BUTTON, 0  ; CR_BUTTON holds Button[0] GT (R only)
  → Abstract Manager → Button.state read → DR1 ← buttonState
```

---

## Instruction Routing

### DREAD / DWRITE

When the capability register holds an Abstract GT (type bits = `0b11`), the
Abstract Manager intercepts **before** any mLoad call:

```
DREAD  DR1, CR3, 0    ; CR3 holds Abstract LED[0] GT
  → Abstract Manager → _dispatchAbstractDread
  → Read LED[0] state → DR1 ← (this.ledBits >> 0) & 1
  ; No mLoad, no memory access
```

```
DWRITE DR1, CR3, 0    ; DR1=1 → turn LED[0] ON
  → Abstract Manager → _dispatchAbstractDwrite
  → this.ledBits |= (1 << 0)
  ; No mLoad, no memory access
```

Permission checks happen inside the Abstract Manager (R for DREAD, W for
DWRITE), not through mLoad.

### CALL

CALL on an Abstract I/O GT routes to the **Abstract Manager** via the M-window
and dispatches a device method.  No mLoad occurs; the GT descriptor is decoded
from DR11 (set by `_setMWindow`) before dispatching.

```
CALL CR0              ; CR0 holds Abstract LED[0] GT, DR1[1:0] = method selector
  → Abstract Manager → _dispatchAbstractCall
  → DR1[1:0] = 0b00 (Set)  → ledBits |= (1 << 0); DR1 ← 1 (new state)
  → DR1[1:0] = 0b01 (Clear) → ledBits &= ~(1 << 0); DR1 ← 0 (new state)
  → DR1[1:0] = 0b10 (Toggle) → ledBits ^= (1 << 0); DR1 ← new state
  → DR1[1:0] = 0b11 (State)  → DR1 ← (ledBits >> 0) & 1
  ; No mLoad, no lump access
```

The method selector is encoded in **DR1[1:0]** before the CALL instruction.
The result (new LED state: 0=off, 1=on) is written back to DR1 after dispatch.
M-window is used internally (CR→DR11–DR15) but is cleared with `writeBack=false`
after dispatch — the GT descriptor word itself is never modified by a CALL.

For Abstract GT types other than I/O, or unknown ab_types, CALL faults with
`INVALID_OP`.

---

## M Abstraction (`ab_type = 0x01`)

The M Abstraction allows privileged inspection and modification of a 5-word
capability register through the DR window.  Only CR15 can have M=1.  See
`.local/tasks/abstract-gt-encoding.md` for the full M API design.

Hardware implementation of the CR→DR M-window is tracked in Task #432.

## Helper Functions

### JavaScript (simulator.js)

```js
// Create an Abstract LED GT for LED pin 2
const ab_data = (ChurchSimulator.DEVICE_CLASS_LED << 8) | 2;
const gt = sim.createAbstractGT(ChurchSimulator.AB_TYPE_IO, {R:1, W:1}, 0, ab_data);

// Parse an Abstract GT word
const info = sim.parseAbstractGT(gt);
// { ab_type: 0, R: 1, W: 1, type: 3, gt_seq: 0, ab_data: 0x0102,
//   device_class: 1, device_data: 2 }
```

### Python (server/boot_image.py)

```python
from server.boot_image import (
    create_abstract_gt, AB_TYPE_IO, DEVICE_CLASS_LED
)

ab_data = (DEVICE_CLASS_LED << 8) | 2   # LED pin 2
gt = create_abstract_gt(AB_TYPE_IO, {"R": 1, "W": 1}, 0, ab_data)
# → 0x07800102
```

---

## Format Tag

`BOOT_IMAGE_FORMAT_TAG = 0xB0070431` — bumped from `0xB0070406` (Task #406) when
Abstract UART/Button/Timer GTs replaced the Inform GTs in c-list slots 14–16.
Both `server/boot_image.py` and `simulator/simulator.js` must agree on this value.

History:
- `0xB0070406` (Task #406): Abstract LED GTs (slots 8–13); NS slot 12 freed
- `0xB0070431` (Task #431): Abstract UART/Button/Timer GTs (slots 14–16); NS slots 11/13/14 freed

## CR15 M-Window Hardware Mechanism (Task #432)

### Overview

The **M-window** grants a thread momentary write-access to its own namespace
CR (CR15).  It is implemented entirely in hardware via a 1-bit M-flag latch
and a **5-word shadow** (DR11–DR15 / XR11–XR15):

| Shadow word | ctmm signal | hardware signal | Content |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| DR11 / XR11 | `m_xr11`    | `m_dr11`        | Abstract GT word (word0\_gt) |
| DR12 / XR12 | `m_xr12`    | `m_dr12`        | NS entry word0\_location |
| DR13 / XR13 | `m_xr13`    | `m_dr13`        | NS entry word1\_authority |
| DR14 / XR14 | `m_xr14`    | `m_dr14`        | integrity32(DR12, DR13) |
| DR15 / XR15 | `m_xr15`    | `m_dr15`        | NS entry word3\_seals (version + seal) |

DR14 / XR14 holds a 32-bit integrity tag computed as `integrity32(location, authority)`.
DR15 / XR15 holds the advisory seals word; writeback validates `GT.version == seals.version`.

### M-flag lifecycle

| Event | M-flag before | Action | M-flag after |
|-------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| M-set (`cr15_m_set`) | 0 | Copy CR15 → DR11–DR15; set flag | **1** |
| Valid writeback (`cr15_m_writeback_trigger`, DR11 non-NULL, integrity + version ok) | 1 | Pack DR11–DR15 → CR15 via `cr_wr`; clear flag | **0** |
| NULL GT writeback (`cr15_m_writeback_trigger`, DR11 NULL) | 1 | Raise `INVALID_OP` fault; clear flag | **0** |
| CHANGE / cross-domain RETURN | 1 | No FSM trigger; flag preserved | **1** |
| Global reset (`clear_all`) | any | Wipe all registers | **0** |

### Signal map

| Signal | Direction | Width | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|-------|---------|
| `cr15_m_set` | in | 1 | Pulse to copy CR15 shadow + set M-flag |
| `cr15_m_writeback_trigger` | in | 1 | Pulse to validate DR11 and initiate writeback |
| `cr15_m_flag` | out | 1 | Current M-flag (combinatorial) |
| `dbg_m_dr11/12/13/14` | out | 32×4 | Shadow DR reads for test inspection (hardware) |
| `dbg_m_xr11/12/13/14/15` | out | 32×5 | Shadow XR reads for test inspection (ctmm) |
| `dbg_cap_wr_en/addr/data` | in | — | Debug cap-register write port (ctmm testbench) |
| `m_set_en` (registers) | in | 1 | Enable CR15 → DR11–DR15 copy + set flag |
| `m_clear_en` (registers) | in | 1 | Clear M-flag (no writeback) |

### FSM states

The M-window FSM lives inside `ChurchCore` / `CTMMCapCore`:

```
IDLE ──(trigger + valid DR11)──→ WRITEBACK ──→ IDLE
     └─(trigger + NULL DR11) ──→ FAULT     ──→ IDLE
```

- **IDLE**: M-set is a combinatorial single-cycle enable (no state change needed).
- **WRITEBACK** (1 cycle): `mwin_cr_wr_en` + `mwin_m_clear_en` → CR15 updated.
- **FAULT** (1 cycle): `mwin_fault_valid` (`INVALID_OP`) + `mwin_m_clear_en`.

`mwin_busy` is HIGH in WRITEBACK and FAULT only, stalling instruction fetch.

### Validation (writeback guards)

WRITEBACK applies three checks in order; any failure raises `INVALID_OP` and clears M:

1. **NULL GT**: DR11 `gt_type` field must be non-NULL.
   - ctmm: GT_TYPE_NULL = `0b10`; bits `[1:0]` of XR11.
   - hardware: GT_TYPE_NULL = `0b00`; bits `[24:23]` of DR11.
2. **Integrity**: `integrity32(DR12, DR13) == DR14` (shadow consistency tag).
3. **Version**: `GT.version == seals.version` — `DR11.version` (ctmm bits `[31:25]`) must
   equal `DR15.version` (ctmm bits `[31:25]`); hardware compares `dr11.gt_seq` vs `dr13.gt_seq`.
   This revocation check catches writes using a stale M-window from a reclaimed GT slot.

A valid writeback packs DR11–DR14 back into CR15 and clears M.

> **Hardware vs ctmm writeback asymmetry**: The production `hardware/` core uses a
> 3-word `CAP_REG_LAYOUT` (word0\_gt + word1\_location + word2\_auth), so DR15 (the seals
> word) is **advisory-only** in the hardware writeback path — it is used for the
> version/revocation check but is not written back to `CR15`. The `ctmm_cap_amaranth/`
> simulator uses a 4-word `CAP_REG_LAYOUT` (adds `word3_seals`) and **does** write XR15
> back. This is intentional and internally consistent: the hardware validates seals at
> dispatch time (NS gate) rather than persisting them in the cap register.
