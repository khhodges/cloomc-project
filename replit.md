# Church Machine Educational Platform

## Overview

The Church Machine is a capability-secured processor architecture with an educational IDE, designed for the Tang Nano 20K FPGA. Its primary purpose is to provide a web-based integrated development environment where children can write, compile, test, and deploy Church Machine programs. The architecture employs capability-based security with Golden Tokens, allowing for secure and scalable use from family/school settings to larger organizations. This platform aims to make computer architecture and secure programming accessible through a hands-on, interactive learning experience.

## User Preferences

- Church Gold dark theme
- Mobile-responsive for parent mode on handsets
- All feature flags True for Tang build
- No separate dynamicObjects — all entries in namespaceObjects
- B (Bind) bit defaults to 0, auto-cleared by CALL
- C-Lists only have E permission, CLOOMC only X or RX
- Phase 1 + 1b + 1c + 1d: English, JS, Haskell, and Symbolic Math (Ada) front-ends implemented; auto-detected by compiler
- Interactive Math "Compile Session" button: compiles interactive let-bindings to Church Machine code via symbolic math front-end

## System Architecture

The system is composed of hardware (Amaranth HDL for FPGA), a web IDE (HTML/JS/CSS), and a Flask backend.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
The web IDE features nine views (Math, Code, Tutorial, Dashboard, Namespace, Abstractions, Pipeline, Reference, Docs) and incorporates interactive learning tools:
- **Interactive Math:** A calculator with a "Compile Session" feature for converting let-bindings to Church Machine code.
- **HP-35 Calculator:** A pure lambda calculus implementation of the 1972 HP-35 scientific calculator, including RPN engine and Church numeral operation tracing.
- **Abacus:** A soroban-style abacus with digital readout and Church Machine trace for operations.
- **Slide Rule:** A logarithmic slide rule with draggable scales and trace of Church Machine operations.
- **Math Challenge:** A sidebar providing grade-appropriate problems with hints and dual-domain explanations (Turing/Church).
- **History Tab:** Dynamic historical stories related to the active math tool, encouraging contextual learning.
- **Syntax Tab:** Quick-reference cheat sheet for the currently selected language, auto-updates on language change.
- **Responsive Design:** Panels often use a 50-50 split with draggable dividers, adapting to narrow screens.
- **Popups:** Educational popups for welcome, math guide, and individual tool guides enhance the learning experience.
- **State Persistence:** Utilizes localStorage for editor state, settings, progress, and dismissals.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Abstraction Model:** A scale-free model where each of 45 abstractions across 9 layers functions as a security block with MTBF tracking.
- **Security Model:** Based on 32-bit unforgeable Golden Tokens with specific permission bits (R, W, X, L, S, E) and a 7-step mLoad pipeline for robust capability handling. Domain purity ensures strict separation between capabilities (Church domain) and code/data (DATA domain).
- **NS Entry and Lump Layout:** Defines the structure of Namespace entries and memory lumps for abstractions. Lumps are power-of-2 allocated (minimum 32 words). Code at offset 0, c-list at allocSize-clistCount, freespace between.
- **Self-Documenting Abstractions:** Every upload.json includes a `doc` block with author, date, language, description, tags, method signatures, capabilities, and sourcePreview. Auto-generated from compiler output and student settings. Displayed in the Abstractions view detail panel.
- **Mum Tunnel Library:** GitHub-backed shared abstraction library. Server API (`/api/library/browse`, `/api/library/get/<path>`, `/api/library/publish`) pushes/reads from a GitHub repo. UI: Library modal with search, language filter, card grid, import/publish. Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_LIBRARY_REPO` environment variables.
- **CLOOMC++ Compiler:** A multi-language compiler targeting the 20-instruction Church Machine instruction set. It supports English, JavaScript, Haskell, and Symbolic Math (Ada Lovelace's notation) front-ends. The compiler auto-detects language from source syntax and outputs in a JSON format for abstraction deployment.
- **Navana Master Controller:** Acts as the sole writer for Namespace entries, managing abstraction creation, allocation, and secure deployment by validating uploads and enforcing security constraints.
- **Instruction Set:** Comprises 20 instructions, evenly split between Church (capability-focused) and Turing (data manipulation) sets, all supporting ARM-style conditional execution.
- **Hardware Target:** The Tang Nano 20K FPGA (Gowin GW2AR-18) is the primary hardware target, with all features enabled (CHANGE/SWITCH, SEAL_CHECK, FUSED_OPS, GC). It uses specific pins for UART, LEDs, and buttons.
- **WebSerial:** Used for deploying compiled programs to the Tang Nano 20K FPGA.

## GitHub Integration Note

The Replit GitHub connector was dismissed by the user. To enable the shared library, manually set these environment secrets:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — A GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope
- `GITHUB_LIBRARY_REPO` — The GitHub repo path (e.g., `username/CLOOMC`)

The repo should have a `library/` directory. Abstractions are stored as `library/<language>/<name>.json`.

## External Dependencies

- **Python/Flask:** Powers the web server backend.
- **SQLite:** Used as the local database (`server/church_machine.db`).
- **Amaranth HDL:** Employed for hardware synthesis of the FPGA design.
- **localStorage:** Used for client-side state persistence within the web IDE.
- **oss-cad-suite:** Provides the FPGA toolchain, including `yosys`, `nextpnr-gowin`, `gowin_pack`, and `openFPGALoader`.
