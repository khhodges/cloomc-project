"""Tests for defence-in-depth DOMAIN_PURITY fault when loading malformed GTs.

Task #953: Validate permission bits when loading GTs from memory, not just
at creation time.

Verifies that a GT word written directly into a C-List slot in memory
(bypassing createGT(), as a STORE instruction or adversarial harness could
do) triggers a DOMAIN_PURITY fault when a LOAD instruction reads that slot
and tries to place the GT into a CR.

Two malformed cases are tested:
  1. Mixed Turing+Church permissions (X+E) — caught by isDomainPure.
  2. Multi-Church permissions (L+E) — caught by isSinglePerm.

In both cases parseGT() sets 'malformed=true' on the decoded result and
_execLoad() surfaces it as a DOMAIN_PURITY fault before the GT reaches
any CR, completing the defence chain that createGT() begins at
construction time.
